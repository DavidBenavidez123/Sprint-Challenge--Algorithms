a) This piece of code has a runtime of O(N) because the while loop is of O(1) * O(N)

b) This has the following O(N) * O(N) * O(N) * O(N) = O(N^4)

c) This is O(N) because O(1) * O(N) = O(N)

Exercise 2 Strategy:

Like a binary search , I would go half way through the building and see if it breaks there, then check the upper half of the building and see if it breaks there and the lower half to see if it breaks there, and so on and so fourth.
